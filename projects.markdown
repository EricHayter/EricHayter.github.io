Some projects I've worked on:
- **[yadb](https://github.com/EricHayter/yadb)**: Yet Another Database is a project
  to build a relational database with C++. It's currently a work in progress
  but I've got a [blog](https://www.erichayter.com/yadb-docs/) setup where
  I'll be posting my progress and sharing some information about database
  internals as I pick them up myself.
- **[.obj renderer](https://github.com/EricHayter/renderer)**: A renderer I
  built for the .obj file formatter. It doesn't use any GPU computation
  but can still reach up to 90 FPS on my T470s with models with 1K+ vertices.

- **[QNX Remote Process Monitor](https://github.com/EricHayter/qnx-rpm)**: A
  tool for developers using the QNX RTOS to remotely monitor processes running
  on their device while providing helpful time series data to track resource usage.

- There's a few other projects on my [github](https://github.com/EricHayter)

- **[CHIP8 emulator](https://github.com/EricHayter/CHIP8)**: An emulator for
  chip 8 architecture to run games and other programs.
