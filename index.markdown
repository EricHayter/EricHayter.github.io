Hi, my name is Eric Hayter.

I'm a student at the University of Ottawa, studying Computer Science and Mathematics. I focus on systems programming and spend most of my time working in modern C++.

I'm especially interested in databases, high-performance computing, and tackling complex, low-level problems. I enjoy building efficient systems from the ground up and learning how things work under the hood.

Right now, I'm developing [yadb](https://github.com/EricHayter/yadb) (Yet Another Database), a relational database written in C++ designed to be simple, functional, and educational.
