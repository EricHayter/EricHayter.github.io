Hi, my name is Eric Hayter.

I'm a student at the University of Ottawa, studying Computer Science and
Mathematics.

Right now, I'm developing [yadb](https://github.com/EricHayter/yadb)
(Yet Another Database), a relational database written in C++ designed to be
simple, functional, and educational. I also do some OSS stuff on the side
for [DragonflyDB](https://github.com/dragonflydb/dragonfly).

While you're here check out some of my [photos](/photos) :)
